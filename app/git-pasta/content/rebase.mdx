## Rebase and rewriting history

```bash
# Move current branch to commit-sha and reset staging area,
# but keep working directory unchanged
git reset [commit-sha]

# Reapply commits on top of another base tip
git rebase [branch]

# Interactive rebase to edit, reorder, squash commits
git rebase --interactive [commit-sha]
```
